        Hi, I'm Jinka Nandivardhan -- a passionate web developer focused on buiulding clean, responsive, and user-centric websites.
        I specialize in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js, and I enjoy turning design
        concepts into interactive digital experiences. My goal is to write a efficient, maintainable code
        that delivers both performance and style.

            Whether it's a personal project or a client-focused solution, I approach every task with attention to detail and a
            problem-solving mindset. I'm always learning new tools and techniques to saty current in this fast-evolving field and
            love building things that not only look good but also worl seamlessly across all devices.
