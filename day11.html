        <p>Hi, I'm Jinka Nandivardhan — a passionate web developer focused on building clean, responsive, and user-centric websites. I specialize in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js, and I enjoy turning design concepts into interactive digital experiences.</p>
        <p>Whether it's a personal project or a client-focused solution, I approach every task with attention to detail and a problem-solving mindset. I'm always learning new tools and techniques to stay current in this fast-evolving field and love building things that not only look good but also work seamlessly across all devices.</p>
        <p>Beyond coding, I’m deeply interested in optimizing performance and ensuring accessibility so that every user has a smooth experience. Collaboration excites me — I enjoy working with teams where ideas can grow, and I also thrive independently when bringing a project from concept to completion.</p>
        <p>Currently, I’m exploring backend technologies and expanding my skills in full-stack development to create more complete, end-to-end solutions. My long-term goal is to contribute to impactful projects that solve real-world problems while continuously improving as a developer</p>
